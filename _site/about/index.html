      <p>My name is Antonella and I am an internationally active scientist. I studied Physics in my hometown Pavia, Italy, a beautiful city with a fascinating history and a long academic tradition. The University of Pavia (<em>Alma Ticinensis Universitas</em>) was funded in 1361, and Pavia is home to a fairly unique network of Colleges - in this sense, the only other Italian University to compare with is Pisa. I was myself alumn of Collegio Ghislieri, funded in 1567 by Pope Pius V, and being a <em>Ghislieriana</em> triggered the set of events that brought me where I am today.</p>

<p>Indeed, my scientific <em>vita</em> is far from linear. During my last year of highschool I was actually considering to study art at the Accademia di Brera in Milan! Somehow, I instead opted for the Bioengineering curriculum, thinking that science as a hobby is less trivial than art. There is where the College environment was instrumental for me to understand my real academic interests. Half-way through the first year, I got extremely frustrated at how little insights we were given on fundamental subjects like Analysis, Geometry and Basic Physics. This had nothing to do with the teachers - the Professor for Analysis I and II was a renowed Applied Mathematician, whose colorful way of teaching is what made me understand I wanted more than what the Engineering curriculum offered.</p>

<p>Talking with College mates, I realized I was in the wrong place: the Physics department is where all the cool stuff was explained and demonstrated. I engaged then in my first transition, made challenging by the fact that, if I wanted to keep my Alumn status in Ghislieri, I needed to pass all my exams by the end of the academic year and with above average grades. In summer 2005 I finished my first year in Engineering, registered to the second year of Physics and started studying for the extra exams I needed to pass to fulfill the Physics 1st year curriculum. I was lucky to be able to count on the support of my fellow College mates to slowly fill my knowledge gaps and get right on track with the more demanding classes.</p>

<p>Funny enough, I went to Physics 100% sure I wanted to study Biomedical Physics. After the first half of my third year I changed my mind and wanted to study Matter Physics, but when I had to choose the topic for my Bachelor Thesis, Particle Physics came out as the absolute winner. It was 2007, and the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva was about to start smashing protons at unprecedent energies… how could I resist the call? Hence I chose the Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics Curriculum for my Master, and I will never regret it. In 2009, for my Master Thesis project, I got a scholarship from Collegio Ghislieri to spend five months at the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and at CERN, Centre Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, where under the joint supervision of Dr. Giacomo Polesello (Pavia) and Prof. Allan Clark (Geneva) I first joined the ATLAS Collaboration and performed an analysis of Monte Carlo simulated proton-proton collision data aimed at discovering signals from supersymmetric particles.</p>

<p>Success is a mixture of talent and luck, and if I think about how lucky I was I start getting doubts about my talent at all. The LHC started beam collisions in 2008, but had to stop soon enough for a small incident. It restarted again at the end of 2009, which is basically when I got my Master degree and started looking around for PhDs. I was freshly into my PhD when on March 30th 2010 the LHC recorded the first collisions at 7 TeV. I remember a full CERN Main Auditorium where I got goose bumps realizing that sitting around me there where scientists that spent the last 30 years actually building that thing, while I was there completely out of luck of being at the right place at the right time. I would have had all those beautiful data to play with for the next 3 and something years, with no other merit than being born in 1985.</p>

<p>I had not considered a PhD at all before going to CERN, but when I was there, also thanks to the interactions I had with amazing scientists (first of all my supervisor Giacomo) I soon realized I wanted more of that. Thanks to connections I made in Geneva, I learned of a PhD opportunity at the Institut de Física d’Altes Energies (IFAE), Barcelona, Spain, and after my supervisor highly praised the IFEA group as one of the best in the ATLAS Collaboration, I had little doubts about where I wanted to go. Yes, the beauty of Barcelona also had some influence, but at the time I was so nerdly in love with CERN that I had no objections when I was told I would be based in Geneva.</p>
