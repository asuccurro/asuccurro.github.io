								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p>My name is Antonella and I am an internationally active scientist. I studied Physics in my hometown Pavia, Italy, a beautiful city with a fascinating history and a long academic tradition. The University of Pavia (<i>Alma Ticinensis Universitas</i>) was funded in 1361, and Pavia is home to a fairly unique network of Colleges - in this sense, the only other Italian University to compare with is Pisa. I was myself alumn of Collegio Ghislieri, funded in 1567 by Pope Pius V, and being a <i>Ghislieriana</i> triggered the set of events that brought me where I am today.

								<h2>My research</h2>
								<p>Here is a collection of short summaries of my research activities (starting from 2010, when I joined IFAE) and few memories (sometimes with pictures, but I usually forget to take any, and I have basically none from the pre-smartphone era).</p>

								<h2>Outreach</h2>
								<p>Receiving my early scientific training at CERN means I got an imprinting that I will never (hopefully) get rid of. I am obsessed with open science, knowledge transfer and giving back to the tax-payers that fund our research. CERN is a European research organization, whose budget mostly comes from contributions of the 21 member States. As Director General Fabiola Gianotti likes to put it, CERN costs to each European Citizen one cappuccino per year.</p>
