  <h3>Outreach activities and material</h3>
  <p>Receiving my early scientific training at CERN means I got an imprinting that I will never (hopefully) get rid of. I am obsessed with open science, knowledge transfer and giving back to the tax-payers that fund our research. CERN is a European research organization, whose budget (about 1.1 billion euro per year) mostly comes from contributions of the 21 member States. As Director General Fabiola Gianotti likes to put it, CERN costs to each European Citizen one cappuccino per year. It is not much in perspective, but it still means that these money are invested into fundamental science of which most of the funding bodies (the citizens) have no clue about. This is why CERN has at the heart of its mission not only scientific advancement but also education, outreach and knowledge transfer. </p>

  The <a href="https://www.ceplas.eu/en/home/">Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences (CEPLAS)</a> is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) under the Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments. CEPLAS is focused on research, education and training of young scientist, but runs also several outreach programs and has always been extremely supportive with me and colleagues willing to offer <a href="http://www.qtb.hhu.de/archiv/plantsday2015.html">additional outreach activities</a>. 
CEPLAS Planter's Punch collects outreach articles written by CEPLAS PhD students and Postdocs about their research. I wrote mine in April 2018, accompained by an introductory video which was a lot of fun to create. <a href="https://www.ceplas.eu/en/discover/planters-punch/2018/understanding-metabolic-interactions-in-plant-root-associated-bacterial-communities/">You can read the full article here</a>, and browse as well the Planter's Punch from my CEPLAS colleagues.
