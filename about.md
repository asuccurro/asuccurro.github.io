I am a scientist by training with many cross-disciplinary interests. My professional tech-skills include data science (AI, machine learning, statistics), biology (microbiology, plant science, human health), computer science (software development, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling).

I have great communication skills (writing and presenting scientific and technical contents to diverse audiences), project management skills (in particular working with cross-disciplinary teams and stakeholders), and I am an extremely creative individual with an innate attitude to apply design thinking principles in solving wide ranges of problems.

In my personal and professional life I am committed to achieving impactful goals with a positive, can-do attitude. I care a lot about climate, sustainability, civil rights and equal opportunities. I apply my knowledge and skills as a member of the non-profit organization Science for Democracy, for which I volunteer on topics such as open science, equal opportunities, ethics of AI, citizens science.
